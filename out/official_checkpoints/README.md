# Model Weights

This directory should contain the trained Uni-Sign model weights.

## Training Instructions

This project uses the Uni-Sign model. To obtain the trained weights:

### 1. **Original Repository**
```
https://github.com/ZechengLi19/Uni-Sign
```

### 2. **Training Dataset**
Train the model on the **OpenASL dataset** following the original Uni-Sign training instructions.

### 3. **Place Trained Model Here**
After training, place your trained model file here as:
```
out/official_checkpoints/official_openasl_pose_only_slt.pth
```

**Quick Start**: If you have a pre-trained model, place it in `out/official_checkpoints/official_openasl_pose_only_slt.pth`
